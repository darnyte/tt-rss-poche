Adds support for sharing links from tt-rss (http://tt-rss.org/) to Poche (http://www.inthepoche.com/).

Just copy the poche folder in you tt-rss plugin directory.

Enable it and configure in tt-rss preferences panel.

Compatible tt-rss >= 1.7.9

I don't follow ALL tt-rss upgrades, so I can't see always if anything breaks.
If you find something broken, please open an issue or a pull request!

Enjoy.
